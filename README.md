#Chrome Extension for Time Tracking and Productivity Analytics

#Project Overview

The Chrome Extension for Time Tracking and Productivity Analytics is a full-stack project that helps users monitor, analyze, and improve their productivity while browsing the internet. 

The extension runs in the background of the Chrome browser and automatically tracks the time spent on different websites. 

It classifies websites into productive (for example, coding platforms or educational sites) and unproductive (for example, social media or entertainment websites) categories.

All user activity data is sent to a backend server and stored in a MongoDB database, allowing historical analysis and visualization on a dashboard. 

Users can view weekly and daily productivity reports, including charts, graphs, and summaries of productive and unproductive time. 

This tool helps users identify time-wasting habits, manage their online activities, and improve focus. It is suitable for students, professionals, and remote workers who want to manage their time effectively.

#Features

Real-Time Website Tracking: Automatically records time spent on websites without manual input.

Website Categorization: Differentiates websites into productive and unproductive categories.

Backend Data Storage: Stores all activity logs in MongoDB for historical tracking.

Analytics Dashboard: Displays trends, daily and weekly summaries, and website-specific reports.

Weekly Productivity Reports: Highlights productive versus unproductive activities to help users improve time management.

Cross-Platform Compatibility: Works on any desktop with Google Chrome.

#Tools and Technologies Used

The Chrome extension is built using Manifest V3 and JavaScript to track browsing activity. 

The frontend dashboard uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive interface. 

The backend is developed with Node.js and Express.js to handle API requests and store data in MongoDB. 

Chart.js is used to display analytics visually on the dashboard. 

Git and GitHub are used for version control and collaboration. 

The entire project is developed using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for efficient full-stack development and debugging.

#Architecture

The project follows a full-stack architecture with three main components:

Chrome Extension (Frontend): Captures real-time website activity and sends it to the backend.

Backend Server (Node.js + Express): Receives and processes the activity data, stores it in the database, and provides endpoints for the dashboard.

Database (MongoDB): Stores activity logs, including website URLs, time spent, categories, and timestamps for historical analysis.

This architecture ensures low-latency updates, real-time tracking, and seamless synchronization between the extension and dashboard.

#Applications

Personal Productivity: Helps users understand their online habits and improve focus.

Corporate / Remote Work: Can be used by teams to analyze productivity trends while respecting privacy.

Education: Students can monitor study time versus leisure browsing.

Time Management Coaching: Coaches can provide recommendations based on real data.

Behavior Analysis: Helps understand internet usage patterns and encourage productive habits.

Add custom website categories for personalized tracking.

Implement user authentication for multi-user support.

Provide alerts for excessive unproductive browsing.

Allow export of productivity reports in PDF or Excel formats.
